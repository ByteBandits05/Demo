    "2. A 'targets' section with three environments: dev, qa, and prod.",
    "   - The dev environment must have 'default: true' set.",
    "   - Each environment should specify the workspace host and the explicit root_path for the bundle.",
    "3. A 'resources.jobs' section defining two jobs: 'pytest' and 'smoke_test'.",
    "   - Each job should include:",
    "     a. An explicit name.",
    "     b. A tasks list with a notebook_task.",
    "     c. Each notebook_task must use an explicit, full notebook_path showing the workspace hierarchy (e.g., '/Workspace/Demo/files/pytest/test_file' for pytest, '/Workspace/Demo/files/smoketest/smoke_test' for smoke_test).",
    "     d. Each job should set a timeout_seconds value (pytest: 3600, smoke_test: 1800).",
    "     e. Enable queueing, set performance_target to STANDARD.",
    "     f. Add tags with environment set to '${bundle.target}' and job_type as appropriate.",
    "4. Do not use any variables for host, root_path, or notebook paths; use explicit values throughout.",
    "5. Add inline comments explaining the purpose of each section, each job, and the notebook task hierarchy.",
    "6. Output must be clear, clean, and ready for production use, making it easy for a user to see all task notebook paths at a glance.",
    "7. root_path should not have environment name and should always deploy to workspace/<Repo Name>."
